			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This site is meant to be a hub for a set of beginner steps on learning a number of coding languages. 
            I plan on giving a number of basic guides on python and C# but others could be included as well. Some extra 
            tips will also be provided to learn some things related to certain fields as well, such as making games.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This site is mainly aimed at those who are new to starting out to coding,
                 and those who have an idea on what they want to work on specifically.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The Dynamic elements will be used to hide and show the various langauges and their respective langagues. 
                If one selects python, then, it'll show things related to python, and the same for C#, or perhaps another language in the future.
			 I think dynamic elements can also be used to check code, such as have we practiced in certain activities.</p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a href="https://coolors.co/1e1e1e-ffca28-e91e63-00acc1-aabd8c" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/1e1e1e-ffca28-e91e63-00acc1-aabd8c</a>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#1E1E1E]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#FFCA28]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#E91E63]</td>
						<td class="accent2">[#00ACC1]</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->
